This project contains all the projects that implement the Pavanecce VDML (Case Management Model and Notation) runtime. VDML is a new modeling language that was designed to model, analyse and simulate the performance of business entities against a set of metrics pertaining to value delivery. If your are new to VDML, please read this short [introduction](vdml-intro.md).

It consists of the following sub-projects:

1. The [VDML Core](pavanecce-vdml-core/readme.md) that implements the core VDML runtime semantics.
2. The [VDML REA](pavanecce-vdml-rea/readme.md) module to support costing and accounting.
